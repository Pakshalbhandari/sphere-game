# sphere-game
This project implements a camera system that rotates evenly around a focal point positioned at the center of an island environment. The camera rotation is controlled by horizontal input from the player. Additionally, the player can control a textured sphere, moving it forwards or backwards towards the focal point.

## Features

- **Camera Rotation:** The camera smoothly orbits around the focal point, providing a dynamic view of the island environment.
- **Player Control:** A textured sphere serves as the player's avatar, allowing them to move forwards or backwards towards the center of the island.
